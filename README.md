				                  Scikit-learn Python library for beginners in Data Science
Scikit-learn Python library implements a range of machine learning, preprocessing, cross validation and visualization algorithms using a unified interface. It focusses on modeling data not on loading and manipulating data. Some popular groups of models provided by scikit-learn include:
• Clustering: for grouping unlabeled data such as KMeans.

• Cross Validation: for performance estimation of supervised models on unseen data.

• Datasets: for test and generating datasets with specific properties for investigating model behavior.

• Dimensionality Reduction: for reducing the number of attributes in data for summarization, visualization and feature selection such as Principal component analysis.

• Ensemble methods: for combining the predictions of multiple supervised models.

• Feature extraction: for defining attributes in image and text data.

• Feature selection: for identifying meaningful attributes from which to create supervised models.

• Parameter Tuning: for getting the most out of supervised models.

• Manifold Learning: For summarizing and depicting complex multi-dimensional data.

• Supervised Models: a vast array not limited to generalized linear models, discriminate analysis, naive   bayes, lazy methods, neural networks, support vector machines and decision trees.

Scikit-learn come with a few standard datasets for exploration of different models provided, for instance the iris and digits datasets for classification and the boston house prices dataset for regression.
Scikit-learn is a great place to start  as it provides access to high-quality, easy-to-use, implementations of popular algorithms. 

Installation(for Windows):
Install the 64bit version of Python 3, for instance from https://www.python.org.
Then run:
$pip install –U scikit-learn 

To verify your installation you can use:
$python -m pip show scikit-learn           # to see version and where scikit-learn is installed

$python -m pip freeze         # to see all packages installed

$python -c  "import sklearn; sklearn.show_versions()"
